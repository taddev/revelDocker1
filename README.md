## revelDocker1
Not a very original name, but this is a test of running the [Revel Framework](https://github.com/revel/revel) inside a [Docker](https://docker.com) container. This is intended to be a sample application to test/demonstrate how to incorporate Github with the Docker autobuild functionality. The base image used is the [google/golang](https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/google/golang/) image provided by Google. I believe I have structured the Dockerfile in a proper manner and the test image does seem to build and function as expected. Being my first attempt at this I'm sure I've done something wrong somewhere, but for now I feel this is correct.
